## Podcasts

You know what podcasts are, and you are probably even aware of how podcasts are taking over content distribution on the web. The best take I've found is from [Ben Thompson of Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/2017/podcasts-analytics-and-centralization/), and, in fact, from his [podcast](http://exponent.fm/episode-118-podcasting-and-centralization/). If you haven't listened to it or read it, go do that now! I'll still be here.
